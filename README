This progam is full of bugs and glitches and the code is really ugly in most parts of the programm.
This is not a coincedent, since it basically is a throw away application which I wrote for a University course, DO NOT GO IN TO ANYTHING THAT IS REMOTELY PRODUCTION LIKE WITH THIS.

That beeing said I am uploading this for other students so they can see how I handeled and interpreted the FDD that where handed down to us by the faculty.

Now go kick your brains out reading some code.

And most of all have fun.
